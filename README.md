# Bank Implementation project
An implementation of a simple bank where there is only one type of account, two users can transfer money to each other 
,a user can deposit or withdraw from their account as well (as long as there is enough money in the account).
There is a frontend website (not accessible from google at the moment and I'm working on the UI) and a back end.
Back end consists of a java file that does the transfers and a database (in PostgreSQL) that stores the info of
all users.
Front end is just a website (they haven't been linked at the moment).
